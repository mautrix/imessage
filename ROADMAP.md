## Android SMS
The android-sms connector is deprecated in favor of [mautrix-gmessages](https://github.com/mautrix/gmessages).

#### Supported
* Plain text (SMS)

* Group chats
* Backfilling history from the Android SMS database.
* Storing messages in the Android SMS database
  (so you can still switch to a different SMS app).

* Any features that SMS/MMS don't support
  (replies, reactions, read receipts, typing notifications).

  * [x] At startup
  * [x] When receiving message
* [ ] Private chat creation by inviting Matrix puppet of iMessage user to new room
* [ ] Option to use own Matrix account for messages sent from other iMessage clients
  * [x] Automatically with shared secret login
