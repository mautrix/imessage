# mautrix-imessage
A Matrix-iMessage puppeting bridge. The bridge can run on a Mac to bridge
iMessage or an Android phone to bridge SMS. All features are available when
using a Mac with SIP disabled, while a normal Mac can be used for basic
bridging. A [websocket proxy](https://github.com/mautrix/wsproxy)
is required to receive appservice events from the homeserver.
